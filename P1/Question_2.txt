The average income of those buying incidentals is slightly less than that of the 
general population.  Those that buy incidentals rent more movies over the 
course of the year but the rentals per visit is about the same for both groups.
According to the data, those buying incidentals show a preference for Action movies. Although
comedies were rented the least amongst both group, the incidentals group showed a greater
disparity in the rental of comedies. 

From the data, the gender distribution for the general population is 26 men and 24 women and
the gender distribution for those buying incidentals is 16 men and 10 women.  This shows that
the percentage of the general male population that buys incidentals is much greater than the
percentage of the general female population that buys them, namely, 62% (16/26)
verses 42% (10/24).

Given the above analysis, male customers renting Action and Drama films should be targeted for 
the purchase of incidentals.
